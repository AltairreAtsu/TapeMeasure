Hello and thank you for installing the Tape Measure mod!
To get started simply place the Tape Measure start block wherever you would like to begin your measurement.
Next place the Tape Measure end block wherever you would like to end your measurement.
These blocks do not need to be in line and it is even possible to measure a 3d volume.
To measure the distance simply tap either block with a stick.
